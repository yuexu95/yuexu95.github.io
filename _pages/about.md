Iâ€™m Yue Xu, a postdoctoral fellow at the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, affiliated with UHN-PRiME. My research lies at the intersection of medicinal chemistry, nanomedicine, and artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, I focus on developing high-throughput screening platforms to optimize lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for various biomedical applications. 

During my academic journey, I earned a PhD in medicinal chemistry from China Pharmaceutical University. In my current role, I am particularly interested in leveraging AI to accelerate drug discovery processes. By integrating machine learning models with experimental workflows, I aim to enhance the reproducibility, explainability, and scalability of scientific research. My goal is to bridge the gap between computational predictions and experimental validation, enabling more efficient and precise therapeutic development.
