I’m Yue Xu, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto’s Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, affiliated with UHN-PRiME. My research is at the intersection of medicinal chemistry, nanomedicine, and AI, where I build high-throughput screening platforms for lipid nanoparticle (LNP) development. I specialize in lipid design and synthesis, with applications in gene therapy, cancer immunotherapy, and intranasal vaccination.

Previously, I completed my PhD in medicinal chemistry at China Pharmaceutical University and have since published high-impact research on lipid droplet imaging, CRISPR delivery systems.

Outside of the lab, I think a lot about how AI can accelerate drug discovery, and how we might make scientific research workflows more reproducible, explainable, and scalable.
